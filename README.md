# MosaicMaker
Create mosaics with or without a subimage album

This project is a Java desktop application for generating mosaic images from a given base image. The program can generate the mosaic from a user-provided image collection or from automated online image searches.

## Technologies Used

- [git](https://git-scm.com/) for source code version control. We recommend the git command line or [GitKraken](http://www.gitkraken.com/) client, though any client will work.
- [Java 8](https://www.java.com/) for desktop application code.
- [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) with Maven for IDE and dependency management.
- [Multicolr by TinEye](http://labs.tineye.com/multicolr/) for online image searching by color.
- [Apache HttpComponents Client](https://hc.apache.org/) for easy API calls.

## TODO

- Option to fill missing subimage with average tile color instead of black
- Filter subimages by keyword
- Option to change mosaic modes from subimage to average color
- Add Google Images support?
- List subimages used to create mosaic
- Resizing mosaic should resize preview
- Preview should show subimages as generating is processed
